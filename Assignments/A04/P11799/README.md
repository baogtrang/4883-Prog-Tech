### Bao Trang

## Description

This folder contains a solution for the "Horror Dash" problem from the UVA Online Judge. The problem involves determining the minimum speed a clown must maintain to not get caught by the fastest creature in a race. The solution reads a series of test cases, each specifying the number of creatures and their speeds, then computes and outputs the maximum speed.
