### Bao Trang

## Description

This solution addresses the "Searching for Nessy" problem from UVA Online Judge. The problem involves determining the minimum number of sonar devices needed to scan Loch Ness in a grid pattern. Each sonar device scans its own cell and the contiguous cells, and the border cells do not need to be scanned.
