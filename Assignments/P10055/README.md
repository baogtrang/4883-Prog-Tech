## Hashmat the brave warrior - 10055
### Bao Trang

### Description:

Hashmat is a brave warrior who, with his group of young soldiers, moves from one place to another to fight against his opponents. Before fighting, he just calculates one thing: the difference between his soldier number and the opponent’s soldier number. From this difference, he decides whether to fight or not. Hashmat’s soldier number is never greater than his opponent's.
