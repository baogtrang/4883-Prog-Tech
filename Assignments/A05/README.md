## A05 - Traffic lights
### Bao Trang
## Project Description
The Traffic Lights problem involves determining the moment when all the traffic lights on multiple streets are green simultaneously. This simulation considers the cycles of different traffic lights and calculates the earliest time at which all lights are synchronized to be green. The challenge lies in handling the various cycles of lights and determining the synchronization point, if it exists, within a given time frame.
